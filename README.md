## 1. Overview

The **Agricultural Insurance Management System (AgriInsure)** is an end-to-end web application built to digitize and simplify the agricultural crop insurance lifecycle. It bridges the gap between rural farming communities and insurance administrators by replacing paper-heavy, slow assessment processes with a centralized modern portal.

### The Problem Addressed
Established crop insurance systems often suffer from fragmented policy catalogues, opaque claim evaluation timelines, high administrative friction, and the lack of accessible meteorological context during field damage verifications. This application provides a unified workspace where farmers can easily browse protection plans and submit claims, while administrators can evaluate incident data and inspect real-time weather conditions before making settlement decisions.

### Primary User Roles
* **Farmers (Users)**: Explore available crop protection policies, file formal loss claims with incident Indications, track multi-stage claim evaluation progress, and monitor live regional weather conditions.
* **Administrators (Insurers)**: Maintain standardized insurance policies, track overall claims metrics and platform resolution statistics, inspect filed claims, fetch supporting meteorological proxy data for incident locations, and record transparent approval or rejection decisions.

### Core Workflow Interaction

```text
Farmer / User Workflow:
  Farmer Registers / Logs In
      ↓
  Browse Standardized Crop Policies (/policies)
      ↓
  File Incident Claim with Date, Crop, & Loss Details (/submit-claim)
      ↓
  Track Multi-Stage Claim Status & Reviewer Notes (/claims)
      ↓
  Monitor Regional Hazard Conditions & Weather Context (/farmer-dashboard)

Administrator Workflow:
  Admin Logs In to Operations Center (/admin-dashboard)
      ↓
  Create, Edit, or Deactivate Crop Policies (/admin/policies)
      ↓
  Inspect Incoming Damage Claims Queue (/admin/claims)
      ↓
  Fetch On-Demand Weather Context for Claim Location
      ↓
  Record Reviewer Notes & Issue Final Approval / Rejection
```

## 2. Why This Project

Farming communities routinely face unpredictable climate hazards—such as droughts, flash floods, hailstorms, and unseasonal frosts. However, accessing financial protection and receiving claim payouts is often hindered by systemic bottlenecks:

1. **Manual & Fragmented Claim Processing**: Physical paperwork and fragmented spreadsheets cause prolonged delays, leaving Exposed farmers without timely compensation following severe weather events.
2. **Lack of Centralized Policy Catalogs**: Farmers frequently lack clear visibility into covered crop types, premium costs, maximum indemnity limits, and active policy durations.
3. **Opaque Claim Tracking**: Once a claim is filed, claimants often have no way to verify whether their submission is queued, under review, or resolved.
4. **Disjointed Weather Context**: Adjusters and claim reviewers rarely have immediate access to meteorological readings for the incident location, making verification cumbersome.
5. **Need for Role-Based Governance**: Sensitive operations (such as approving payouts and modifying policy financial terms) must be strictly isolated from general user capabilities.

The **Agricultural Insurance Management System** addresses these issues through a responsive, role-protected platform that streamlines administrative workflows and provides transparent claim visibility.

## 3. Key Capabilities

### Farmer / User
* **Secure Authentication**: Register as a Farmer and log in securely with JWT-based session management.
* **Policy Catalog**: Browse active insurance policies with transparent coverage amounts, annual premiums, crop types, and terms.
* **Claim Submission**: Submit damage claims by selecting active policies, damage causes (e.g., Drought, Flood, Pest Infestation), incident dates, farm locations, detailed descriptions, and evidence URLs.
* **Real-Time Status Tracking**: Monitor claim progress across visual lifecycle stages (*Claim Submitted* &rarr; *Verification & Review* &rarr; *Final Decision*).
* **Audit & Notes Visibility**: View official administrative review notes and evaluation timestamps for settled claims.
* **Live Weather Monitoring**: Interactive meteorological widget featuring temperature, humidity, wind velocity, sky conditions, and an agricultural risk assessment indicator (*Low*, *Moderate*, *High Risk*).

### Administrator
* **Admin Authentication & Route Protection**: Dedicated administrative access control preventing unauthorized role tampering.
* **Operational Dashboard**: Visual metric cards displaying Total Claims, Pending Reviews, Approved Claims, Rejected Claims, Total Policies, and Active Policies alongside a claim resolution pipeline rate.
* **Policy Lifecycle Management (CRUD)**: Create new crop policies, update existing policy specifications, and safely deactivate outdated policies with confirmation modals.
* **Claims Queue & Filtering**: Filter and search the complete claims ledger by farmer name, email, policy, crop, damage category, or status (*Pending*, *Approved*, *Rejected*).
* **External Weather Verification Context**: On-demand lookup of atmospheric data (temperature, wind speed, humidity, condition, and severe weather alerts) for the claim location via a secure backend proxy.
* **Decision Pipeline & Reviewer Notes**: Record formal evaluation rationale and issue binding approvals or rejections with confirmation dialogs.

## 4. Feature Overview

### Authentication & Authorization
* **JSON Web Token (JWT) Security**: Stateless authentication with tokens stored securely on the client and attached via Axios request interceptors.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Distinct permissions for `Farmer` and `Admin` roles enforced at both the Express API middleware layer (`verifyToken`, `verifyAdmin`) and client-side route guards (`ProtectedRoute`, `GuestRoute`).
* **Registration Controls**: Public registration restricts self-assignment to the `Farmer` role; administrative accounts must be provisioned internally.

### Insurance Policy Management
* **Dynamic Policy Creation**: Administrators can define policy names, targeted crops (e.g., Rice, Wheat, Corn), annual premium amounts, maximum coverage limits, duration terms, and operational descriptions.
* **Safe Policy Deactivation**: Policies can be deactivated without deleting historic claims or cascading foreign keys, preserving data integrity.
* **Farmer Discovery**: Farmers can view all currently active policies, filter by crop type, and initiate claims directly from policy cards.

### Claim Management
* **Structured Claim Intake**: Farmers submit claims with client-side form validation (past incident dates, mandatory field locations, and policy association).
* **Three-Tier Processing Pipeline**: Visual tracking component displaying exact timeline progress and timestamped audit logs.
* **Comprehensive Review Modal**: Administrators can review farmer credentials, policy financials, incident details, attached evidence URLs, and reviewer notes in an accessible, scrollable modal view.

### Weather Integration
* **Secure Backend Proxy Architecture**: Weather queries route through the Express API proxy (`GET /api/weather?city=...`), keeping the `WEATHER_API_KEY` private and unexposed to client bundles.
* **Agricultural Risk Heuristics**: The farmer dashboard evaluates temperature extremes, precipitation, and wind speeds to determine regional hazard risk tiers.
* **Advisory Reference Only**: Meteorological information inside the claim review modal serves as external supporting context for adjusters and does **not** automatically approve or decline claims, preserving human oversight.
